# Carbon Emission Project SQL and PowerBI
***In this project, I will analyze and visualize my dataset using SQL and PowerBI.***
***I will use this dataset to discover some aspects: India's highest and lowest amount of carbon emission by Year, the country with the most significant and most downward emissions per capita in 2017 compared to the changes of emissions per capita in 1975,...***

## About the dataset: 
- There are two databases in my project: 

###### a. Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/united-nations-environment-data?select=Water+and+Sanitation+Services.csv)
- Overall: The database contains the amount of carbon emissions per capita in a country and total carbon emission in countries over the world. 
- Tool: SQL to clean and analyze, PowerBI to visualize

###### b. Reduced Carbon Emission Database: 
- Source: [UN - environment program](https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/)
- Overall: This database contains information about how much carbon emissions can be reduced in six sectors. 
- Tool: PowerBI to visualize
